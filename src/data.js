            "text": "Adopting population health management strategies is the next step for more than 40% of large employers (>5,000 employees) struggling to contain rising healthcare costs and retain talent, according to a recent EBN survey. Facing an aging workforce and a rise in chronic conditions, employers are increasingly turning to a proactive, data-driven approach to improving the health of the workforce as a whole. The goal? Healthier, happier, more productive employees and lower healthcare costs.  At the same time, however, nearly 80% of these employers say they have limited knowledge of population health. How, for example, do they ensure their population health management strategy doesn\u2019t become a one-size-fits-all approach for their employees? That an individual\u2019s unique circumstances and healthcare needs don\u2019t get lost as employers focus on categorizing people based on conditions and risk?  The following five principles can help put the \"personalization\" into your population health management strategy: ",

The information gleaned from these interactions must be combined with personal health data \u2013 claims, utilization management data, risk scoring, biometrics, lab results, and data from point solutions \u2013 to form a complete personal health profile.

Developed in the 1990s by Dr. Harold Freeman, patient navigation is a patient-centric care delivery model designed to help people overcome the complexity of a fragmented healthcare system and eliminate barriers to care. Ideally, patient navigators function outside of the healthcare system but in partnership with it, developing trusted, one-on-one relationships with individuals and helping them transition smoothly in and out of care settings in the community. Patient navigation can serve as the \u201cglue\u201d for disconnected care processes and be an effective way to put the individual at the center of care.",
